This is the English fork. If new features are introduced, I will localize as possible. If you want to bring a feature in, have a translation request in a particular file, or want to help out with translations, please let me know (@jsarcade or evan.burchard+tyranoscript@gmail.com). Translation status is at the bottom of this readme.  

## Main Features

### Runs with HTML5 and JavaScript
Applications will run on iPhone, iPad, Android, etc.  
Also, using tools like PhoneGap, applications can be ported to be sold on the AppStore or Android marketplace.  

Of course, games will also run on desktop browsers.  
Using an expansion pack, you can also distribute games as Windows applications.

### KAG３/吉里吉里(kirikiri) Compatible
TyranoScript is made with KAG3/吉里吉里 compatability in mind.  
For that reason, windows games made with KAG3 can easily be ported to the web and smartphones!
### Smooth integration with JavaScript
TyranoScript allows for using JavaScript freely throughout.  
### Free for individuals or for businesses
Free to use as you wish, including commercially.  
Original software is open source (MIT License) and free to the public.
## How to Use
